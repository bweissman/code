# MVP Check
Get a subscription ID (see https://github.com/lazywinadmin/MVP) and set it using the SubscriptionKey variable

Also adjust the name to look for and the StartDate

The script will check all your contributions that have a URL, if:

- The URL is valid
- If your name is on that page (doesn't work for sessionize, PDFs etc.)

Hope, this is helpful!
